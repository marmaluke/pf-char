This stardust causes the target to shed light as a candle, and it cannot benefit from concealment or any invisibility effects. The creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks. This penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of -6 at 20th level. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the shaman's level (minimum 1). Sightless creatures cannot be affected by this ability.
